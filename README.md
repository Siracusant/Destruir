### *「 Destruir 」NET-ENC* _`constructing`_

***Hi guys. I thought I have to tell you that the code is only a rough idea at the moment.*** *But pls not to leave so quickly. If it is possible, even given my daily time constraints, it could take years before the project is developed to a working state. But if you can, would you like to, stop and pay attention? This may be the motivation for me to continue to create personal value in my spare time :)* ***Thanks.***

***The dynamic of dev-ing Destruir for me:*** 

*Previous good open source software in the same area, such as `V2ray`, `ShadowSocks`, `Clash`, etc., has been blocked. But the nascent `Dae` seems to have put a higher bar on the people to use, additionally, it is not easy to get started with. At the same time, some of the temporary substitutes may be not functional enough, and some may be not safe enough to use, or not easy to use.* 

*Obviously, it's not advisable to keep using the old applications from many years ago, but I still did not see a great, safe and easy-to-use alternative similar to `Clash` in a period of these years(In fact there are some news, but as for me, none of them satisfied me. But for you(everyone see the text here), the situations may be not as same as mine). I have a strong interest in GO and Internet development, so I wanted to make a powerful (e.g. `DAE`), multi-platform compatible (e.g. `Clash`), easy-to-use and modern web proxy and encrypted transport software. That's why I did `Destruir`.*

*I hold that during the development of `Destruir`, the open source community will emerge with a lot of good, more advanced agent software. Since I am more interested in the development of `Destruir` with the purpose of exploring the unknown, and my actual technical level is limited, the results may be just garbage that mixed with long-term painstaking efforts, sweat and time (cough). But even if the time is tight, I trust, I can complete its development work step by step. Because, I credit I can deepen my thinking and bring me a lot of practical experience in the process.*

***The gossip is enough. By the Golang, let us go.***
